# PS-Attendance
A Python & Selenium Script to automate PS attendance.

The scripts are:

`submit.py`: For testing

`submitpi.py`: Creates a virtual display so that the Selenium scipt can run on a server.

It uses the Twilio Messaging API to remind the user via text message that the attendance is marked.
